## Understanding System Requirements for Large-Scale Systems

We're going to talk about **gathering, classifying and analyzing requirements** as the first step in designing a large scale system.

System requirements is just a formal word for figuring out and narrowing down what exactly we need to build for our client.

As software engineers, we shouldn't be new to receiving informal requirements for the task we need to accomplish. But when it comes to the design of a large scale system, there are a few differences from the usual requirements we are used to getting for implementing a method, an algorithm or a class.

### Differences in Scope and Abstraction

- **Scope and Level of Obstruction**: The first difference is the scope and level of obstruction of the requirements and especially the solution we need to design. 
  - For example, when we're tasked to implement a method or an algorithm in an existing code base, we typically know what the input and output look like. We are also somewhat limited to the programming languages we're going to use.
  - As we go up to a more high level obstruction like designing a class, a module, a library or an application, the range of possible ways to solve the problem becomes bigger and bigger as we have more degrees of freedom.
  - Also the scope of the problem becomes so high that it's hard for us to even visualize the implementation.
  - So when we are asked to design an entire system we may feel so overwhelmed that we may not even know where to begin.
  - For example, imagine you are asked to design a file storage system, a video streaming solution, or a ride sharing service, it needs to scale to serving millions of users per day. It's hard not to get overwhelmed by such a task.

### Challenges of Ambiguity

- **Level of Ambiguity**: The second challenge and difference from what we're normally used to is the level of ambiguity. The reason for this ambiguity is twofold.
  - **Non-Technical Stakeholders**: First of all, in many cases, the requirements are not even coming from an engineer, and sometimes they're not even coming from a very technical person. So the client or product manager may ask for something very high level. And it's our responsibility to transform those requests into precise and technical requirements. Those technical requirements will serve as the foundation for building our software architecture.
  - **Requirements as Part of the Solution**: The second reason for the high level of ambiguity is getting the specific requirements is already part of the solution. This may seem a little odd for us at first, but we have to remember that the client doesn't always know exactly what they need. The only thing they know for sure is the problem they need to solve.

- **Example: Hitchhiking Service**:
  - Let's say we're asked to design a hitch hiking service that allows people to join drivers that are already driving on a particular route, and are willing to take passengers on their way for a fee. That may be all the requirements we get from the client, and it is up to us to ask things like:
    - Is it going to be a real time service or the riders will have to contact the drivers in advance?
    - Is it going to be a mobile or desktop experience or maybe both?
    - Are we going to enable payment through our system or the riders will have to pay the drivers directly?
  - In some cases, the client may not even know the answer to those questions right away until we actually ask those questions.
  - That is why in most system design interviews, one of the things being tested is our ability to clarify and ask those questions ahead of time. Because as we can see, asking those questions and gathering those requirements is already part of the solution and it greatly narrows down what we need to design and build.

### Risks of Incorrect Requirements

- **Why It Matters**: Now, what happens if we don't get all the requirements right? Can't we just do it incrementally? Why can't we simply build something and see if it satisfies the client? And if it doesn't, no big deal. We can just fix it, can't we? After all, we're not building a building or a bridge here. There's similarly no big cost of materials in software, like in mechanical engineering, for example, or construction of a building.
- **Challenges with Large-Scale Systems**:
  - Well, the mental leap we need to make here from small projects like building a method or a few classes where we can easily rewrite the code many times until we get it right, large scale systems are big projects that cannot be changed easily overnight.
  - Those projects take many engineers, sometimes even multiple teams of engineers.
  - They can take months to build, which makes the cost of engineering time very significant.
  - They also often require purchasing hardware and sometimes software licenses upfront.
  - And those projects typically involve contracts with time commitments and financial obligations.
  - Also not delivering the product to our clients or users on time may cause irreversible damage to our company's reputation and brand image, so getting the requirements right upfront is absolutely critical.

## Classification of Requirements

let's take a step further and learn to classify the requirements into a few categories, which have completely different effects on our architecture and design. The three main types of requirements are features of the system, also known as functional requirements, quality attributes, which are also known as non-functional requirements, and system constraints, which basically the limitations and boundaries of the system.

### 1. Features of the System (Functional Requirements)

- **Definition**: Let's start talking about the first type of requirements, the features of the system. Those requirements essentially describe the system's behavior. In other words, what the system we're designing actually does. 
  - Those requirements are easily tied to the objective of the system.
  - They are also called functional requirements because they essentially describe our system as a black box function. The user's input or external events are the inputs to that function, and the result or outcome of the operation taken by our system is the output of that function.
- **Impact on Architecture**: It's important to point out that the features or functional requirements simply dictate the functionality of our system but do not determine its architecture. And generally any architecture can achieve any feature, which is what makes our job as software architects so difficult.
- **Examples (Hitchhiking Service)**:
  - One functional requirement can be as follows, when a rider logs into our mobile app, the system must display a map with nearby drivers within five miles radius. Here the input to our system is the user's login action, and the output is the view of a map with nearby drivers.
  - Let's take another example. When the ride is complete, the system will charge the rider's credit card and transfer that money to the driver minus some service fees. Here the completion of the ride is the input event, and the transfer of the money is the outcome of the operation.

### 2. Quality Attributes (Non-Functional Requirements)

- **Definition**: Now, let's talk about the second type of requirements, the quality attributes or non-functional requirements. The quality attributes are properties that the system must have as opposed to what the system must do.
  - Examples of such qualities include scalability, availability, reliability, security, performance, and this list can go on and change depending on the system.
- **Impact on Architecture**: In contrast to the functional requirements, the quality attributes do dictate the software architecture of our system. Another way to look at this is, the software architecture defines the system quality attributes. And different architectures provide us with different quality attributes.

### 3. System Constraints

- **Definition**: The last type of requirements is system constraints. A few examples include strict deadlines, limited budget, or a small number of engineers that can work on our project.
- **Impact on Architecture**: Such constraints may force us to make certain trade offs and sacrifices in our design and shift us towards certain software architectural decisions that we would not make if we didn't have those constraints.


 **Architectural Drivers**: The three types of requirements that we learned in this lecture are also sometimes referred to as architectural drivers. Because they essentially drive our architectural decisions from an infinite universe of possibilities towards one solution that satisfies our clients' needs.

### Example : 

We would like you to build a system that allows sharing of large files between users
After a user uploads a file, they will get a unique link that they can share with other users. Any user with that link can download the file.
The link should become active no later than 1 second after the file is uploaded. Download speeds should be at least 50 Mbit/sec.
You have to support at least PDF and JPG file formats, as well as the following web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge

1. **Which part is the functional requirement?**
2. **Which part is the non-functional / Quality Attributes requirement?**
3. **Which part is the System Constraints requirement?**


To answer the query, we need to categorize the parts of the given system description into **functional requirements**, **non-functional (quality attributes) requirements**, and **system constraints requirements**. Let’s break down each term and analyze the provided text systematically.

- **Functional Requirements**: These describe _what_ the system must do—its features, behaviors, or capabilities.
  
- **Non-Functional (Quality Attributes) Requirements**: These specify _how_ the system performs its functions, focusing on qualities like performance, usability, or reliability.
  
- **System Constraints Requirements**: These define the limitations or conditions under which the system must operate, such as specific technologies, platforms, or standards it must adhere to.



**1. Which part is the functional requirement?**
 After a user uploads a file, they will get a unique link that they can share with other users. Any user with that link can download the file
 This describes _what_ the system does: it allows users to upload a file, generates a unique link, and enables downloading via that link. These are the essential functions of the file-sharing system.

**2. Which part is the non-functional / Quality Attributes requirement?**

Non-functional requirements focus on the qualities of the system’s performance. Here, two parts specify _how_ the system should behave in terms of speed and responsiveness:

- **“The link should become active no later than 1 second after the file is uploaded.”**
    - This is a performance requirement, defining the maximum acceptable delay for link activation.
- **“Download speeds should be at least 50 Mbit/sec.”**
    - This is another performance requirement, setting a minimum threshold for download speed. 

These requirements don’t describe what the system does but rather how well or quickly it must perform its functions.
Thus, the **non-functional / quality attributes requirement** is:
The link should become active no later than 1 second after the file is uploaded. Download speeds should be at least 50 Mbit/sec.

**3. Which part is the System Constraints requirement?**
System constraints impose limits or conditions on the system’s design or operation. The final part of the description specifies mandatory support for certain file formats and browsers:

- **“You have to support at least PDF and JPG file formats, as well as the following web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.”**
    - This defines the environment and data types the system must accommodate:  
        - **File formats (PDF and JPG)**: Specifies the minimum types of files the system must handle. While this could be seen as functional (part of what the system does), the phrasing “you have to support at least” suggests a constraint on the system’s scope—limiting or defining the data it must work with.
        - **Browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge)**: Specifies the platforms or environments the system must be compatible with, a classic example of a constraint as it restricts the operational context.
  

In requirements engineering, supported file formats are often functional, but here, the combined phrasing with browsers under **“you have to support”** suggests they are treated as preconditions or limitations imposed on the system.
