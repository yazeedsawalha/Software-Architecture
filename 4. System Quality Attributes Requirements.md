### Exploring Quality Attributes (Non-Functional Requirements)


Now that we thoroughly explored functional requirements as well as how to capture and visualize them, let's expand on the next type of requirements the quality attributes, otherwise known as non-functional requirements. This type of requirements has a direct effect on the software architecture. So let's start with some motivation and a formal definition of a quality attribute.

### Motivation for Quality Attributes

Studies have shown that systems are frequently redesigned and restructured, mostly not because they are functionally deficient or because of new functionality requirements, but because the existing system as it stands is either **not fast enougth,** **can't scale well enough to the growing number of users or volume of data**, or the structure of the system makes development, maintenance, or security very hard. And in most cases, after such a major redesign, the system provides either equivalent or exactly the same functionality as it did before, so architecting our system in a way that provides us with the right quality attributes right from the start is extremely important to avoid such major redesigns.

### Definition of Quality Attributes

Quality attributes are non-functional requirements that describe the qualities of the system's functional requirements, or the overall properties of the system. In other words, the quality attributes do not say what the system does, but instead they provide a **quality measure** on how well our system performs on a particular dimension. And as we mentioned before, the quality attributes have direct correlation with the architecture of the system.

### Example: Quality Attributes in Context

To clarify the definition, let's see how a quality attribute provides a quality measure to a functional requirement. Let's take an example of an online store where users can look for products based on some search keywords.

- So one general requirement may be that when a user clicks on a search button after they typed in a particular search keywords, the user will be provided with a list of products within at most 100 milliseconds.
  - **Functional Requirement**: The action that our system takes when a user clicks on the search button.
  - **Quality Attribute**: In this case in the performance dimension, describes how fast this action is to be performed.

- Another example that is not tied to a particular functional requirement, but instead pertains to our entire system, is that our online store has to be available to the users at least 99.9% of the time.
  - **Quality Attribute**: In this case in the availability dimension.

- Quality attributes don't only need to satisfy the needs of the clients. Instead, they need to satisfy the quality requirements of all the stakeholders. To illustrate this, let's take another quality requirement, which is our development team can deploy a new version of our online store at least twice a week.
  - **Quality Attribute**: This property also pertains to our entire system and describes how our system performs in the **Deployability dimension**.

### Important Considerations for Quality Attributes

So now that we got some intuition for system quality attributes, let's discuss some very important considerations about quality attributes in general when it comes to designing a software system.

### 1. Measurability and Testability

One of the most important considerations about quality attributes is that they have to be measurable and testable. If we can't objectively measure and consistently test to prove that our system satisfies the required quality attributes, then we can't actually know if our system performs well or performs poorly in regards to that requirement.

- **Example**: If the requirement we get is when a user clicks on the buy button, the purchase confirmation must be displayed quickly to the user. Now, if we design a system such that it displays the confirmation within 200 milliseconds. Now, since we couldn't measure what the word quickly really meant, we can't know if 200 milliseconds is good or bad.

### 2. Trade-offs Between Quality Attributes

The second important consideration is that there is no single architecture that can provide all the quality attributes. Essentially, if there was such an architecture, then everyone would use it for every system, and the job of a software architect wouldn't exist. The reason it's impossible is that certain quality attributes contradict with each other, so some combinations of quality attributes are either very hard to achieve or are even impossible. That is why our job as software architects is to make the right trade off, prioritizing some quality attributes over the others, and designing the system in a way that will give us the highest chance for success based on the requirements of the business.

- **Example**: We may have two conflicting requirements for our systems login page.
  - One requirement states that a user should log in to our system very quickly, preferably under one second.
  - The other requirement tells us to provide security to protect the user's account. That entails that for the user to log in, they will need to type in some sort of password. And also to protect that password we need to use something like SSL, which is a technology that allows us to protect that password from being intercepted by a third party.
  - **Conflict**: But making a user type in their username and password, and also making the network request using SSL makes the login process slower, which goes directly against the first requirement to make the login process as fast as possible.

### 3. Feasibility of Quality Attributes

The third important consideration in regards to quality attributes is the feasibility of the requirements. It is up to us, the designers of the system, to make sure that the system that we're attempting to design and later build is even capable of delivering what the client is asking for. In some cases, because the client is not technical, they may ask for something that is either technically impossible or prohibitively expensive to implement, and it is our job to call that out early on in the process.

- **Example 1: Unrealistic Latency**
  - One example of an unfeasible requirement is unrealistic low latency expectations. For example, if the network latency between a client in South America and the closest data center where we run our system in US East is anywhere between 100 or 150 milliseconds, then we cannot guarantee page loads to be less than 100 milliseconds. Actually, we can't even guarantee a latency close to that, because loading a page using HTTP requires multiple round trips as part of its protocol, as well as potentially loading multiple assets.

- **Example 2: 100% Availability**
  - Another example can be a requirement for 100% availability of the system. This basically means that our system can never fail, and we will never have a chance to take it down for maintenance or upgrades.

- **Other Examples**: Other examples of unfeasible requirements can be full protection against hackers, streaming high resolution movies in areas where the bandwidth doesn't allow it, or a requirement for our system to increase its storage capacity at an unreasonable rate.

- **Action**: So before approving a requirement, we may even need to consult with people with domain expertise to make sure that we can actually deliver on what we promise.


We have the following requirements:  
**_1. When a user is performing a search on our system, we need to return as many results as fast as possible.**

- This is not a good quality attribute requirement because it is **not measurable**

**_2. We want to offer unlimited raw, uncompressed video storage for a $1.99 annual subscription fee._**
 - This is not a good quality attribute requirement because it is not feasible
### Summary

We got the motivation for system quality attributes. We mentioned that the majority of the system redesigns happen because the system, as it stands, does not provide the required quality attributes. We also officially defined quality attributes as a measure on how well our system performs on a particular dimension. And finally, we talked about the three important considerations when defining the quality attributes for a system.

- The first consideration was the testability and measurability of the quality attribute.
- The second was the necessity to make trade offs and choose the right quality attributes over the others.
- And the third consideration was the feasibility of the quality attribute, to make sure we can deliver on what we promise.
