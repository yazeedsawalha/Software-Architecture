We're going to talk about the third architectural driver and type of requirement: the system constraints. We're going to talk about a few types of constraints classified by their source and also the effects that the system constraints have on our software architecture. Finally, we will talk about a few considerations that we need to take into account when we deal with system constraints.

### Definition of System Constraints

So what do we mean by system constraints? Typically, once we define the functional requirements and what our system must do, we have a high degree of freedom on how to structure our system. In other words, while defining the final architecture, we have to make a lot of decisions because we typically have many ways to achieve the desired quality attributes and the desired functionality. Specifically when it comes to quality attributes, we are allowed and are typically expected to make tradeoffs.

So a system constraint is essentially a decision that was already either fully or partially made for us, restricting our degrees of freedom. But this is not always a bad thing. Essentially, what I'm alluding to is instead of looking at a constraint from a negative connotation as a choice that was taken away from us, we can also look at it as a decision that was made for us which sometimes makes our job easier. That's why sometimes people refer to system constraints as the pillars for our software architecture. The reason for that is that system constraints provide us with a solid starting point. And since usually constraints are non-negotiable, we sort of need to design the rest of the system around those constraints.

### Types of System Constraints

So what type of constraints can we have in our system? Generally, there are three types of constraints: technical constraints, business constraints, and legal constraints.

### 1. Technical Constraints

As software engineers, technical constraints are something that we deal with every day, so it's not something that is new to us. Examples of technical constraints include things like:

- Being locked to a particular hardware or cloud vendor because of an existing contract or security reasons.
- Having to use a particular programming language because of existing frameworks we built in-house or maybe difficulty hiring engineers.
- Having to use a particular database or technology or having to support certain platforms, browsers, or operating systems because of licenses, support cost, or maybe because our clients specifically ask for that.

On the surface, technical constraints may all seem like they belong to the realm of implementation and not the software architecture. But unfortunately in practice, in many cases, they do affect the decisions we make in the design phase and put restrictions on our architecture.

- **Example 1**: If our company made the decision to run all our services on-premise or our own data centers, maybe for security reasons or financial reasons, then all the cloud architectures and paradigms like out of scaling or function as a service may be either unavailable to us or are very hard to achieve because we would have to implement a lot of non-trivial infrastructure.
- **Example 2**: If we have to support some older browsers or low-end mobile devices that don't support certain communication protocols or can't handle as much data, we would have to adopt our architecture significantly to support those platforms and their APIs while providing a different, more high-end experience for newer browsers or higher-end devices.

### 2. Business Constraints

Now let's talk about the second type of constraint that come from our business. Typically as engineers, we want to make the right decisions and architectural choices from a technical perspective, but we're not always able to assess how those decisions align with the goals of our business. For that reason, we frequently get constraints that come from our business team which force us to make certain sacrifices both in terms of architecture and implementation.

- **Example 1: Budget and Time**: For example, if we get a business constraint in a form of a limited budget or a strict deadline, we will make very different choices than if we had an unlimited budget or unlimited time. In fact, there are certain software architectural patterns that are more suitable for small startups that have to get to the market fast with a small team and there are other architectural patterns that fit much better with bigger organizations that have many engineering teams and a much larger budget
- **Example 2: Third-Party Services**: Besides time and budget limitations, we can also get a business constraint that tells us to use third-party services as part of our architecture.
  - For example, if we're building an online store, we may want to specialize in the experience of the clients who shop on our platform, but use third-party providers to take care of the shipping and the billing.
  - Another example is if we're building an investment platform, we would typically need to integrate with different banks, broker services, as well as security and fraud detection services.
  - Those are all examples of business decisions to specialize in only one area and not get distracted with things that we can get from other partners. But all those third-party providers have their own APIs and architectural paradigms that we would have to work with as part of designing our own system.

### 3. Legal Constraints

Now, finally, the third type of constraint comes from certain rules and regulations. Those constraints may be global or specific to a particular geographical region.

- **Example 1: HIPAA in the US**: For example, in the United States, if you are developing a system that handles medical information or patient's records, you need to adhere to the HIPAA regulations that place certain constraints on who can access the patient's data, as well as the security we need to put in place to store the sensitive information.
- **Example 2: GDPR in the EU**: In the European Union, GDPR sets certain limitations on online services regarding what kind of data they can collect, store, and share with third parties about their users. This regulation also has certain limitations on how long some data can be retained.
- **Context**: So depending on the country where we're planning to offer our services and the industry that our services belong to, we may have different regulations that affect the architecture of our system.

### Considerations When Dealing with System Constraints

Now, once we identify all the constraints, there are two considerations that we need to keep in mind.

### 1. Distinguishing Real vs. Self-Imposed Constraints

The first consideration is that we shouldn't take any constraint that's given to us lightly. What I mean by that is we want to make the distinction between real constraints that there is nothing we can do about and self-imposed constraints that we can negotiate and maybe even remove.

- **Examples**:
  - If we're working with external rules and regulations, maybe there is not much room for us to negotiate.
  - But if we're getting budget and time constraints from our business, maybe there is room to postpone some of the deadlines or stretch the budget.
  - If we are currently locked to a particular hardware, cloud vendor or a particular set of technologies, maybe this project we're working on is the perfect opportunity to explore other options which may benefit our business in the long run.
- **Impact**: Once we agree to take on a set of constraints, it's very hard to back away. And if we find out down the line that those constraints were not real constraints, our overall architecture may just not make any sense anymore.

### 2. Avoiding Tight Coupling to Constraints

This brings us to the second consideration which is that when we do take on certain constraints, we need to leave enough room in our architecture to move away from those constraints in the future.

- **Example**: For example, if we are limited to a particular database that we need to use or some third-party service that we have to integrate with, we need to make sure our system is not tightly coupled to that particular technology or those specific APIs. And if in the future, we are able to use different technologies or different services, we will need to make minimal changes instead of re-architecting the entire system from scratch.
- **Future Discussion**: When we get to the topic of architectural building blocks, we will see many examples of specific tools and general techniques on how we can decouple different parts of the system in a way that they can be easily replaced or updated independently without the need to refactor the entire system.



1. **While building our Multiplayer Online Game, we want to build our own proprietary game engine, to provide a better performance, optimized for our use case. However, because of the strict deadline to release the game by the end of the year, we decided to go with an existing solution called Unreal Engine:**

2. **While designing our multiplayer online game we decided to use Cassandra database for storing the information about our users. However, we couldn't find any engineers in our team who know how to work with Cassandra. We later found out that all the teams in our company are using MongoDB. So we decided to use MongoDB for storing the users' information instead.**

3. **While designing a social media platform for sharing short videos with friends, we came up with the most optimal design and architecture. However, before finalizing the design and starting the implementation we found out that COPPA (The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) , which is a law created to protect the privacy of children under 13, requires us to make significant changes to our design.**
